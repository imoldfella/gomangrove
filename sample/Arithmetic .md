# Arithmetic 
* Use equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators  (2/5 + 7/3 = 6/15 + 35/15 = 41/15)
* Solve word problems with addition and subtraction of fractions or mixed numbers with like and unlike denominators
* Create models or equations to represent problems with fractions
* Understand a fraction as division of the numerator by the denominator
* Solve word problems dividing whole numbers leading to fraction or mixed number answers
* Multiply a fraction by a whole number or a whole number by a fraction
* Find areas of rectangles with fractional sides by modeling with unit squares
* Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing)
* Explain results of multiplying a number by a fraction greater or less than 1
* Use all operations to solve world problems with fractions and mixed numbers
* Compute and explain division of a fraction by a whole number
* Compute and explain division of a whole number by unit fraction
